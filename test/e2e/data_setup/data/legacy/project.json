PCR products are sequence verified and cloned into the standard Gateway entry vector (pENTR/D-TOPO vector, Invitrogen) using the manufacturer recommended protocol. We have generated a Gateway compatible reporter vector that contains a Gateway cassette and a Hsp68 promoter coupled to the LacZ reporter gene.

The mouse embryonic stage was determined according to Theiler staging. RNA abundance was confirmed using the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA integrity was verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer prior to analysis on Affymetrix GeneChips (microarrays). Total RNA samples (1 microgram per sample) were converted into biotin-labeled cRNA using the GeneChip IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix). Fragmented cRNA was applied to GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix) that contain probe sets designed to detect over 39,000 transcripts. The microarrays were hybridized and processed on a GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix) and scanned on a GeneArray Scanner (Affymetrix) at the USC/CHLA (Childrens Hospital Los Angeles) Affymetrix core facility using manufacturers recommended protocols. We generated scaled log2 transformed gene expression values for each probe set based on the RMA algorithm.

 {"id":158,"grant_number":"U01DE020050","description":"<div>\r\n\tThe goal is to develop principled algorithms to reveal genotype-phenotype disease associations. This requires the development of computational techniques to represent, quantify, and analyze variants of biological morphology from imaging sources, such as CT scans, MRI scans, and stereo cameras.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tOur main priority is to create software tools that significantly improve access to 3D craniofacial data. Our research on craniofacial image analysis and retrieval has produced software that can be used by the craniofacial research community to help analyze facial abnormalities. The software works on 3D head meshes and is general in that it can be used for analysis of multiple conditions. We have used it for quantification of the following disorders: craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (which includes some mid-face hypoplasia), and cleft lip/palate.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tFor analysis of the 3D mesh data, we have developed software for the following general tasks:</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<strong>1. Local Feature Extraction</strong></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThis set of modules is used to compute low-level local features at each vertex of a mesh. The local features that we can construct are: Azimuth Angle, Elevation Angle, Absolute Gaussian Curvature, Besl-Jain Curvature, and Shape Index. The Local Feature Smoothing module applies a Gaussian filter to smooth the local features so they are less noisy.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<strong>2. 2D Azimuth-Elevation Histogram&nbsp;</strong></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThis module computes azimuth and elevation angles of the surface normal vectors of each point on the mesh and constructs a 2D histogram. This histogram can be used in classification or quantification tasks.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<strong>3. Landmark Analysis</strong></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThe Auto-Landmarks module calculates 17 landmarks on the face using only 3D geometry: pronasale, sellion, subnasale, left and right alare, left and right alare curvature, left and right chelion, left and right superaurale, left and right postaurale, left and right endocanthion, left and right exocanthion. The Deformation module deforms a target mesh to a source mesh using the correspondence of the auto-landmarks calculated on both meshes. Then, using the deformed target mesh, any number of pre-marked landmarks can be transferred from the source mesh to the target mesh.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThe Pseudo-Landmarks module extracts a given number of points on the face using equally-spaced points on equally-spaced horizontal planes.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<strong>4. Symmetry Analysis</strong></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThis group of modules is used for quantization of face symmetry. The Mirror Symmetry Plane module calculates the center point and the normal vector of the symmetry plane. Using this plane, the Symmetry Score modules calculate different symmetry scores for points or grids on the face.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<strong>5. Automatic Skull Extraction</strong></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThis module produces a skull mesh from a stack of CT images. We have used this module as a pre-processing step in our work on quantification of craniosynostosis.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThe majority of our modules are available in our web-based application, CranioGUI.
