             * - `iiif_version`: The version of iiif server that should be used (default is 2)
             * - `image_url_pattern`: the url_pattern to transform the value of `image_url_column_name` into something
             *    that OSD understands. in the `image_url_pattern` you have access to two variables:
             *    - `iiif_version`: the IIIF version number defined (default is 2)

             *     to convert a hatrac url into a url that OSD can use to fetch the images.
