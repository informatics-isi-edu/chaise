# Chaise (Computer-Human Access Interface with Schema Evolution) [![Build Status](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/chaise/workflows/Chaise%20end-to-end%20tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/chaise/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Chaise+end-to-end+tests%22+branch%3Amaster)


A suite of web applications that adapt to the data model for data discovery, analysis, visualization, editing, sharing and collaboration.

Chaise is the main front-end component of the [DERIVA asset management Platform](http://isrd.isi.edu/deriva) and utilizes [ERMrestJS](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/ermrestjs) client library to interact with the DERIVA services including [ERMrest](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/ermrest) (a general relational data storage service), [webauthn](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/webauthn) (authentication provider framework), [Hatrac](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/hatrac) (an object store service), and [deriva-web export](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/deriva-web/blob/master/docs/export/api.md) (allows export from an ERMrest catalog).

## Applications

Chaise includes the following applications:

<table>
  <tbody id="all-apps-table">
    <tr>
      <th>App</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th width="400px">Screenshot</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Recordset</strong></td>
      <td>
        Provides faceted search and text search over an entity set, using structured queries with joins and filter predicates.
        <ul>
          <li> The facet panel contains a list of facets, each of which offers predicate values applicable to further filter the current result set</li>
          <li>Search results are displayed as tabular data, showing a subset of entity details and providing navigation to per-entity RecordEdit or Record application instances</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td><img height="275" alt="Recordset screenshot" src="https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/chaise/assets/2129750/11d39c51-7b7a-45f3-ad94-799b154dea1d" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Record</strong></td>
      <td>
        Presents details of an entity of interest as well as summaries of related entitiesâ€”entities that reference or are associated with the entity of interest.
        <ul>
          <li>An embedded editing component allows management of binary associations or creation of new child records.</li>
          <li>The related entity sets are usually displayed as embedded tabular sets, but this can be customized.</li>
          <li>Scientific data visualization, such as plots or 3D rendering, can be flexibly integrated into the display.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td><img height="275" alt="Record screenshot" src="https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/chaise/assets/2129750/0f73c8e8-1200-4b5a-a8e8-bae79230f928" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Recordedit</strong></td>
      <td>
        Enables users to create, edit, or delete an entity or
set of entities in the database.
        <ul>
          <li>Data entry forms are built based on the ERM, with appropriate input fields for different column types or constraints</li>
          <li>Available and selected foreign entities are displayed with human-readable entity names while populating actual foreign key fields with their often cryptic values</li>
          <li>The form adapts to access rights, e.g., disabling inputs on fields immutable by a given user.</li>
        </ul>

## How it works

The following papers describe Chaise in detail:

* Model-Adaptive User Interfaces For Collaborative Scientific Data Management. Tangmunarunkit, H.; Shafaeibejestan, A.; Chudy, J.; Czajkowski, K.; Schuler, R.; and Kesselman, C. In Copenhagen, Denmark, March 2020. [pdf](http://isrd.isi.edu/downloads/Chaise_EDBT2020.pdf)
* Model-Adaptive Interface Generation for Data-Driven Discovery. Tangmunarunkit, H.; Shafaeibejestan, A.; Chudy, J.; Czajkowski, K.; Schuler, R.; and Kesselman, C. In Sophia Antipolis, France, June 2020. [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01781.pdf)

Chaise is intended to support specific user interactions, as briefly introduced above (e.g., discovery, analysis, editing, etc.). As such, its presentation capabilities are narrowly scoped to support these interactions. Thus, Chaise makes a few assumptions about how users will interact with the underlying data.

A few representative but non-exhaustive examples of these assumptions include:
- search, explore, and browse collections of data
- navigate from one data record to the next by following their
  relationships (i.e., following links)
- add, edit, remove data records from the database
- create, alter, or extend the data model itself
- subset and export data collections
- share data with other users
- annotate data records with [tags] or [controlled vocabulary] terms

[tags]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)
[controlled vocabulary]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary
[data model]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model
[denormalized]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization

Beyond these baseline assumptions about basic usage, Chaise makes almost no assumptions about the structure of the underlying [data model], such as its tables, columns, keys, foreign key relationships, etc. Chaise begins by introspecting the data model by getting the `catalog/N/schema` resource from [ERMrest]. The schema resource includes lightweight semantic annotations about the model in addition to the underlying relational database schema.

Chaise uses its rending heuristics to decide, for instance, how to flatten a hierarchical structure into a simplified (or [denormalized]) presentation for searching and viewing. The schema annotations are then used to modify or override its rendering heuristics, for instance, to hide a column of a table or to use a specific display name in the interface that is different than the column name from the table definition of the schema. Chaise then applies user preferences to further override the rendering decisions and annotations, for instance, to present a nested table of data in a transposed layout (i.e., with the columns and rows flipped).

## How to Contribute

When developing new code for Chaise, please make sure you're following these steps:

1. create a new branch and make your updates to the code in the branch (avoid changing master branch directly);
2. do your own quality assurance;
4. update the e2e tests (if applicable);
5. make sure the liner doesn't throw any errors (`make lint` should not fail);
6. make sure you can deploy your code without any issues (`make dist && make deploy` should not fail);
7. make sure that all tests are passing before submitting the pull request (`make testparallel` should be free of errors);
8. make your pull request, assign it to yourself, and ask someone to review your code.
   - Try to provide as much information as you can on your PR. Explain the issues that the PR is fixing, and the changes that you've done in the PR.
   - Provide examples if applicable.
   - Deploy your changes to a server if applicable and provide links. You should not expect reviewers to deploy your code.
   - Make sure Github Action build is successful before merging your PR.
   - Resolve the conflicts with master before merging the code (and go through the process of making sure tests are good to go).
